<p>I made a smart contract, simulating the evaluation process in a university, where the only one who can evaluate and modify the notes is the teacher, however I also made some public functions where the student or any person who has a valid ID can access the notes and request revisions in case you are not satisfied.</p> 

<p>I had a lot of fun doing this project, as it has further reinforced the fundamentals of solidity that I have learned. </p>

<h2>You can see the smart contract on Etherscan: <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xc1775488d76f9c01c4a1aa03eda42c8753393f94">⛓ Smart Contract Project</a>
